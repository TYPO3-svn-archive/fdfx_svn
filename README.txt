This is extension is only important and helpfull for development of homepages and extensions when several developer and/or designer are working together and a CVS/SVN is used to share the development.

This extensions allows to copy the latest code from a CVS/SVN to the installation.
To do this a script has to be setup. No help to do this from my side.
